# Overview

This is a complete PHP project demonstrating database connectivity capabilities, supporting both external databases and Replit's integrated ReplDB system. The project has evolved from a simple Hello World page into a robust system for database operations and testing. It provides a comprehensive interface for CRUD operations on ReplDB and connection testing for various database types including MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
